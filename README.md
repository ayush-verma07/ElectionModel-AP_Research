# ElectionModel-AP_Research

**Overview**

This repository contains the AI election model developed for my AP Research paper. The model is designed to analyze the accuracy of an AI model in predicting Texas elections. It examines AI-generated political content, election predictions, and targeted campaign strategies to assess their impact on outcomes and how easily one would be able to utilize a similar model for the purposes of predicting elections.

**Purpose**

The primary goal of this model is to provide insights into how AI-driven misinformation, predictive accuracy, and personalized campaigning affect public trust in election integrity. The findings from this model will contribute to my research on the role of AI in modern elections and its implications for democratic processes.
