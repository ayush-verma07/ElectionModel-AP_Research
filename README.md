# ElectionModel-AP_Research

**Overview
**This repository contains the AI election model developed for my AP Research paper. The model is designed to analyze the impact of AI on voter perception and trust in Texas elections. It examines AI-generated political content, election predictions, and targeted campaign strategies to assess their influence on voter behavior.

Purpose
The primary goal of this model is to provide insights into how AI-driven misinformation, predictive accuracy, and personalized campaigning affect public trust in election integrity. The findings from this model will contribute to my research on the role of AI in modern elections and its implications for democratic processes.

Note
This repository is for academic research purposes only and is specifically developed as part of my AP Research paper.
